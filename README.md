# WebGL Sandbox

Dead simple code to get up and running with a WebGL canvas.

```sh
# Sorry silver, no `bun` here ;) Their bundler isnt complete enough
npm i
npm run dev
```

We've got

- Hot module reloading - for shaders and draw calls!
- Draw call instancing
- UVs :)
- Time-based animation
- Reactive thingies
    - Visibility
    - Window size
- GL Context recovery
- Halfway ok errors :>
- Web Components! (ok this was probably a bad idea :D)
